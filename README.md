# Fan Control Code for Arduino 

This code has been made for controlling Vilpe Eco 220P roof fan
with Arduino UNO (Atmega328P).

* Arduino controls fan with PWM to NPN transistor (fan needs 0-10V level)
* PWM duty is controlled using potentiometer (note: PWM uses Timer2).
* LCD can be used to display the set speed value and the tacho signal
coming from the fan circuit (actual spinning RPM)
